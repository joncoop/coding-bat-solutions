# CodingBat Solutions
These are my solutions for the problems at https://codingbat.com/.

### A note about the Java solutions
I teach AP Computer Science A, so I kept most solutions limited to the subset of Java tested in the course. There are some problems that can be solved more easily with built-in Java functions. There are also times where I felt the 'spirit of the problem' was to discover an alogrithm, not dig into the Java documentation to find the solution.

### Are you a teacher that uses CodingBat with your students? 
Check out my [CodingBatGrader](https://joncoop.github.io/codingbat-grader/) which can be used to easily check the progress of your students.
